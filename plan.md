# HomePage Plan
## Server & File type
Nginx is a good choice.I will use static html documents on github and this can also run on a nginx server.
## Files Manager
A File Manager is under consideration.Plan to write it using C++.
## HTML Generater
Writing HTML by hand is so hard, I will be tired of writing HTML oneday.
So I'm in badly need of a HTML Generator.
